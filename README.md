# JUST A SAMPLE PROCEDURE AND CODE FOR IMPLEMENTATION!
# VerseVision
Combining Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Using other Python libraries as well.


## Setting up Environment
Libraries to use-
- `numpy` - for numerical operations.
- `PIL` (Pillow) - for image processing.
- `tensorflow` or `PyTorch` - for deep learning-based image analysis.
- `nltk` or `spaCy` - for NLP

  ```bash
  pip install numpy pillow tensorflow nltk

## Loading and Pre-Processing Images
Using Pillow to load and preprocess images. Converting images into a format suitable for deep learning model.
```bash
from PIL import Image

def load_image(image_path):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    # Preprocess the image as needed
    return img
```

## Using a pre-trained image analysis model
Using a pre-trained model for image analysis. Using model from TensorFlow or Hugging Face Transformers.
- [mobilenet_v2](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification/4)
```bash
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Load a pre-trained image feature extraction model
image_model = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification/4")
```

## Extracting images from the image
Use the loaded image model to extract relevant features from the image. These features will serve as input to your poetry generation model.
```bash
def extract_image_features(image):
    # Preprocess the image for the model
    img_array = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(image)
    img_array = tf.expand_dims(img_array, 0)
    img_array = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(img_array)

    # Get the features from the image model
    features = image_model(img_array)
    return features
```

## Build a poetry generation model
You can use a language model for poetry generation. GPT models, such as GPT-3, are suitable for this task. You can use the OpenAI GPT-3 API or train your own model using libraries like `transformers` for fine-tuning.

## Generate poetry based on image features
Combine the image features and text generation to create a poem that is inspired by the content of the uploaded image.
```bash
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

def generate_poetry(image_features):
    # Convert image features to text
    image_text = " ".join(map(str, image_features.numpy().flatten()))

    # Generate poetry based on image features
    input_text = f"Image features: {image_text}."
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

    output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100, num_beams=5, no_repeat_ngram_size=2)

    poem = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return poem
```

## Integrate with a web application
Use a web framework like Flask or Django to create a simple web application where users can upload images, and your program generates poetry based on the uploaded images.
Here's a minimal example using Flask:
```bash
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def index():
    if request.method == "POST":
        image = request.files["image"]
        image_path = "uploaded_image.jpg"
        image.save(image_path)

        img = load_image(image_path)
        features = extract_image_features(img)
        poem = generate_poetry(features)

        return render_template("index.html", poem=poem, image_path=image_path)

    return render_template("index.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
